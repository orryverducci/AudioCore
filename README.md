üîä AudioCore
===========

AudioCore is a free and open source cross platform audio library for .NET applications. AudioCore supports Windows, macOS, iOS and Android.

AudioCore is developed by [Orry Verducci](http://www.orryverducci.co.uk/).

Why AudioCore?
--------------

AudioCore aims to provide everything you need to be able to playback, process and record audio in your .NET applications. It provides full cross platform support for desktop and mobile applications through a simple API, so you don't need to worry about using different libraries and coding for each platform. Also as an entirely .NET native library, AudioCore doesn't require the use of P/Invokes or any native compilation as often required by other audio libraries.

Development State
-----------------

AudioCore is currently in the early stages of development. Significant changes should be expected, and the API should not be considered final or stable.

The following table shows the current state of each feature:
